# AI Company Growth Simulator

A browser-based management strategy game built with TypeScript-style modular JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Grow an AI startup from training GPT-1 to constructing solar-system scale compute megastructures.

## How to Play
1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser.
2. Use the dashboard tabs to monitor metrics, train new AI models, purchase upgrades, and secure funding rounds.
3. Each model unlocks additional revenue, research speed, and compute efficiency. Balance your cash flow with infrastructure investments to progress toward AGI and ASI milestones.
4. Save, load, or start a new company using the buttons at the top of the page. Progress also autosaves periodically.

## Features
- Chronological AI model progression (GPT-1 through ASI plus image, video, audio, and world models).
- Upgrade trees for compute infrastructure, research, revenue, and partnerships.
- Funding rounds, economic balancing, and news feed flavor text.
- Dynamic charts tracking compute, profit, and AI power over time.
- LocalStorage save system and responsive futuristic UI.
